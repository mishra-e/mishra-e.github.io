                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I worked at the University of Toronto's <a href="https://mishra-lab.ca/ekta-mishra/">Mishra Lab for Mathematical Modelling</a> under the supervision of Drs. Sharmistha Mishra and Jesse Knight. Together, we examined progress on the UNAIDS' <span class="highlight">'first 95 goal'</span> (to have 95% of those living with HIV know about their diagnosis) among Female Sex Workers living with HIV across Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                        <p>Through my work with the Mishra Lab, I became interested in resource scarcity and healthcare equity research. Since then, I have focused my research on health economics issues, to understand better how systemic change may improve equitable access to care. I began working with Dr. Michel Grignon on two projects:</p>
                        <p>First, we are examining <span class="highlight">William Baumol's 'cost disease'</span> in the healthcare systems of OECD countries across Europe and North America. The accurate diagnosis of this macroeconomic disease could explain rising healthcare costs in rich countries.</p>
                        <p>Second, under the supervision of Drs. Michel Grignon and Byron Spencer, I am conducting a retrospective study of mortality trend differentials in Canada, using the <span class="highlight">Age-Period-Cohort model.</span> This project is funded by an <a href="https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/current-students/undergraduate-student-research-award-usra/">Undergraduate Student Research Award</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Teaching</h3>
                        <p>I was a teaching assistant for <span class="highlight">Introductory Calculus A/B</span> from 2022-2024 with Drs. Megumi Harada and Jenna Rajchgot at McMaster University!</p>
